PromptMaster Privacy Policy
Effective Date: February 5, 2026
Last Updated: February 5, 2026
PromptMaster (hereinafter “we”, “us”, or “the App”) respects and protects the privacy of all users. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use the App.
1. Information We Collect

No Personal Identifiable Information
We do not collect your name, email, phone number, ID, location, photos, contacts, or any data that can directly identify you.
Device and Technical Information (Anonymous)
We may collect the following anonymized data to ensure proper functioning and deliver ads:
Device model, OS version, screen resolution
App version, language settings
IP address (used only for aggregated regional analytics, not linked to individuals)
Advertising Identifier (IDFA/AAID) — only if you explicitly grant permission

Usage Data (Anonymous)
We collect anonymized usage statistics, such as:
Which prompt categories you browse
Which templates you copy (content not recorded)
App open frequency, session duration, crash logs
All data is aggregated and cannot be traced back to you personally.

2. How We Use Your Information

To operate core features (e.g., save favorites, search history – stored locally on your device).
To analyze performance, fix bugs, and improve user experience.
To serve non-intrusive ads via Google AdMob (banner ads and optional rewarded videos).
AdMob may use your advertising identifier (IDFA/AAID) only if you consent through the system prompt.

3. Sharing of Information
We never sell, rent, or share personally identifiable information with third parties.
Limited sharing occurs only with:

Advertising Partners: Google AdMob (Google LLC). Data processing is governed by Google’s Privacy Policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy
Legal Requirements: When required by law or government authorities.

4. Your Rights and Choices

Tracking Permission (iOS)
iOS will show “Allow App to Track” prompt. You can choose “Allow” or “Ask App Not to Track”.
If you decline, we cannot access IDFA and ads remain fully anonymized.
You can change this anytime in Settings → Privacy & Security → Tracking.

Local Data Control
Favorites and history are stored only on your device. You can clear them by deleting app data or uninstalling.
Data Deletion
Since we do not store personal data on our servers, no additional deletion is required. Contact us for any concerns.

5. Children’s Privacy
The App is not directed to children under 13 and does not knowingly collect data from them. If you are a parent and believe your child is using the App, please contact us.
6. Security
We use industry-standard security measures (HTTPS encryption, local data protection), but no method is 100% secure over the internet.
7. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted in the App with the updated effective date. Continued use constitutes acceptance.
8. Contact Us
